This document describes how to configure and build the open source XFS
commands and utilites ("xfsdump") from source, and how to install and
run them.

0. If you have the binary rpm, simply install it and skip to step 2 (below).
   The rpm command to do this is:
	# rpm -Uvh xfsdump

   The Debian command to do this is:
	# dpkg -i xfsdump
   or, if you have apt configured (don't need the binary package):
	# apt-get install xfsdump

1. Configure, build and install the package

   The xfsdump package uses autoconf/configure and expects a GNU build
   environment (your platform must at least have both autoconf and gmake). 
   You will also need to have installed either the e2fsprogs-devel package
   (on an RPM based system) or the uuid-dev package (on a Debian system)
   as some of the commands make use of the UUID library provided by these.

   To build the package and install it manually, use the following steps:

	# make
	# su root
	# make install
	[and optionally, for the development libraries and headers]
	# make install-dev

   Note that there are so many "install" variants out there that we
   wrote our own script (see "install-sh" in the top level directory).

   If you wish to turn off debugging asserts in the command build and
   turn on the optimizer then set the shell environment variables:

	OPTIMIZER=-O1
	DEBUG=-DNDEBUG

   before running make or Makepkgs.

2. How to Contribute

   See the README file in this directory for details about how to
   contribute to the XFS project.
