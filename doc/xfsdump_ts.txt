Xfsdump/Xfsrestore Troubleshooting Questions
============================================

SGI Support (relevant for IRIX customers only)
----------------------------------------------
* What is the customer support case number?
* Is there an associated engineering bug number?
* Do you have any existing contacts within SGI?

General
-------
* Have you run xfsdump or xfsrestore before?
* Is this a new problem?  
  And if so, what has changed since xfsdump or 
  xfsrestore last worked correctly?

Operating System (OS)
---------------------
* What versions of the OS are you using now and
  when the dump was made ?
  (IRIX: uname -Ra or Linux: uname -a, cat /etc/issue)
* What patches were installed for the OS ?
* If Linux, what version of the xfsdump package
  are you using?
  (rpm -q xfsdump)
* Is there anything in the /var/adm/SYSLOG file for the period that
  xfsdump or xfsrestore was run?


File System (FS)
----------------
* How big is the filesystem being dumped ?
  (df -kl)
* Does the filesystem have quotas enabled ?
  (mount)
* Is the filesystem managed with DMF ?
* Does the file system use Security attributes such as ACLs ?
* Are extended attributes used in the filesystem ?
* Is the filesystem controlled by CXFS, or the host part of a cluster?

Tape System
-----------
* Is TMF or Openvault used to manage the tapes ?  If so, which versions?
* What kind of tape drive is used ?
* On IRIX, what kind of tape driver is used - tpsc or ts ?
  (eg. attr -g _drivername /dev/rmt/tps4d6)
* Is the drive used in variable or fixed block mode ?
  (IRIX: look at the path for the tape specification) 
  (Linux: mt -f /dev/st0 status; and report the blocksize)
* How many tapes were used for the dump ?

Dump/restore commands
---------------------
* What was the xfsdump/xfsrestore command lines used ?
* What was the output from the commands ?
* If the FS is not too large,
  what is the output with the -v5 option ?
* How big was the dump ?
* What drive strategy was used in the commands?
  (xfsdump -v3 ... |grep "instantiat")
  (xfsrestore -v3 ... |grep "instantiat")
  If you have the -v5 output, then just grep for "instantiat".
* If dumping/restoring to/from a remote host, 
  what is the OS version of that host?
* If xfsdump/xfsrestore seem to take a really long time, use the -p
  option to get progress output.
* What is the output of 'xfsdump -I' ?


Misc
----
* If the problem is related to files not being dumped or restored, and
  you know the inode numbers from the xfsdump/xfsrestore output, what
  files are they associated with?
  (IRIX: xfs_ncheck -i <ino /dev/dsk/<disk_device)
  (Linux: find /<mntpt -local -inum <ino )
